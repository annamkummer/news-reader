## Development

This app was created as a practice take-home challenge, project spec [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe). The goal was to build it out in a limited period of time and be able to speak to the process and organization. User stories were organized as issues in a GitHub project board, and a plan for a responsive layout was designed using Figma, wireframes below.
